# 6. implement Omit<T, K>

In TypeScript, the Omit<T, K> utility type is a built-in generic type that allows you to create a new type by excluding a subset of properties K from an existing type T. This can be useful when you want to work with objects that should not have certain properties from a larger type.

### Syntax

```typescript
type Omit<T, K extends keyof any> = Pick<T, Exclude<keyof T, K>>;
```

### Problem

#

### Problem Description

`Omit<T, K>` returns a new type by picking the properties in T but not in K.

Please implement `MyOmit<T, K>` by yourself.

```ts
type Foo = {
  a: string;
  b: number;
  c: boolean;
};

type A = MyOmit<Foo, 'a' | 'b'>; // {c: boolean}
type B = MyOmit<Foo, 'c'>; // {a: string, b: number}
type C = MyOmit<Foo, 'c' | 'd'>; // {a: string, b: number}
```

#

### Solution

```ts
type MyOmit<T, K extends keyof any> = Pick<T, Exclude<keyof T, K>>;
```

### Explanation

- The [`Exclude<Type, ExcludedUnion>`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#excludetype-excludedunion) helper type returns a new type by removing all union members of `Type` that are assignable to `ExcludedUnion`.

  ```ts
  type Key = 'a' | 'b' | 'c';

  type KeyWithoutC = Exclude<Key, 'c'>;
  // type KeyWithoutC = 'a' | 'b';
  ```

  The ``Exclude<Type, ExcludedUnion>` is defined like this:

  ```ts
  type Exclude<Type, ExcludedUnion> = Type extends ExcludedUnion ? never : Type;
  ```

  - `SomeType extends OtherType ? TrueType : FalseType;` is a [**conditional type**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html):

    > When the type on the left of the `extends` is assignable to the one on the right, then you’ll get the type in the first branch (the “true” branch); otherwise you’ll get the type in the latter branch (the “false” branch).

    ```ts
    interface Animal {
      run(): void;
    }
    interface Fish extends Animal {
      swim(): void;
    }
    type T1 = Fish extends Animal ? number : string;
    // type T1 = number;
    type T2 = RegExp extends Animal ? number : string;
    // type T2 = string;
    ```

    When `SomeType` is a union type, [conditional types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html) become [**distributive**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html#distributive-conditional-types), which means the condition is distributed to each branch of that union type:

    ```ts
    // if T = A | B

    T extends U ? X : T == (A extends U ? X : A) | (B extends U ? X : B)
    ```

  - The `never` type indicates the values that will never occur. When used in [**conditional types**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html), it prunes unwanted cases.

- The [`Pick<Types, Keys>`](./5.implement-Pick-T-K.md) returns a new type by picking the properties in `Keys` from `Type`.



### Use Cases

* **Restricted Views**: When you need to create a version of an object that does not expose certain properties.
* **Security**: When you need to exclude sensitive information from being included in certain contexts.
* **Function Parameters**: When a function should not have access to certain properties of an object.

### Benefits

* **Type Safety**: Ensures that the resulting type accurately reflects the exclusion of specified properties.
* **Clarity**: Makes it clear which properties are intentionally excluded from a type.
* **Flexibility**: Allows you to easily create new types by excluding properties, making your code more modular and reusable.
