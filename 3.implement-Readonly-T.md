# 3. implement Readonly\<T\>

In TypeScript, the Readonly<T> utility type is a built-in generic type that constructs a new type from an existing type T, where all the properties of T are set to be read-only. This means the properties of the resulting type cannot be reassigned after the initial assignment.

### Syntax

```typescript
type Readonly<T> = {
    readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P];
};
```

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/typescript/implement-Readonly-T

#

### Problem Description

`Readonly<T>` returns a type that sets all properties of `T` to `readonly`.

Please implement `MyReadonly<T>` by yourself.

```ts
type Foo = {
  a: string;
};

const a: Foo = {
  a: 'BFE.dev',
};
a.a = 'bigfrontend.dev';
// OK

const b: MyReadonly<Foo> = {
  a: 'BFE.dev',
};
b.a = 'bigfrontend.dev';
// Error : Cannot assign to 'a' because it is a read-only property.
```

#

### Solution

```ts
type MyReadonly<T> = {
  readonly [Key in keyof T]: T[Key];
};
```

### Explanation

* `MyReadonly<T>` takes a type `T` and constructs a new type.
* The new type has all the properties of `T`, but each property is read-only.
* The `readonly` modifier ensures that properties cannot be reassigned.


### Use Cases

* **Immutability**: When you want to ensure that an object's properties cannot be changed after they are set.
* **API Responses**: When you receive data from an API that should not be modified.
* **Configuration Objects**: When you pass configuration objects that should remain unchanged throughout the application's lifecycle.

### Benefits

* **Safety**: It prevents accidental modifications to objects, which can help avoid bugs.
* **Clarity**: It makes it clear to other developers that the object should not be modified.
* **Immutability**: Encourages immutability practices, which can lead to more predictable and maintainable code.
