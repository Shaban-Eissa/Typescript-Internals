# 4. implement Record<K, V>

In TypeScript, the Record<K, V> utility type is a built-in generic type that constructs an object type with keys of type K and values of type V. This can be useful when you want to define an object type with a specific key-value structure.

### Syntax

```typescript
type Record<K extends keyof any, V> = {
    [P in K]: V;
};
```


### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/typescript/implement-Record-K-V

#

### Problem Description

`Record<K, V>` returns an object type with keys of K and values of V.

Please implement `MyRecord<K, V>` by yourself.

Notice that property key could only be `number | string | symbol`.

```ts
type Key = 'a' | 'b' | 'c';

const a: Record<Key, string> = {
  a: 'BFE.dev',
  b: 'BFE.dev',
  c: 'BFE.dev',
};
a.a = 'bigfrontend.dev'; // OK
a.b = 123; // Error : Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
a.d = 'BFE.dev'; // Error : Property 'd' does not exist on type 'Record<Key, string>'.

type Foo = MyRecord<{ a: string }, string>; // Error : Type '{ a: string; }' does not satisfy the constraint 'string | number | symbol'.
```

#

### Solution

```ts
type MyRecord<K extends keyof any, V> = {
  [P in K]: V;
};
```

### Explanation

- `'a' | 'b' | 'c'` is a [**union type**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types):

  > A union type is type formed from two or more types, representing values that may be any one of those types. We refer to each of these types as the unionâ€™s members.

- `Record<K, V>` takes two types: `K` (the keys) and `V` (the values).

- The resulting type is an object where each key `P` in `K` maps to a value of type `V`.

- We didn't use `[P in keyof K]`, because `K` is not an object type. `[P in keyof T]` means `P` is one of the keys of the object `T`.

- `keyof any` is equal to `string | number | symbol`. So the solution can also be written as:

  ```ts
  type MyRecord<K extends number | string | symbol, V> = {
    [P in K]: V;
  };
  ```

### Example

Suppose you want to create a mapping of user IDs to user names. You can use `Record<number, string>` to achieve this:

```typescript
const userNames: Record<number, string> = {
    1: "Alice",
    2: "Bob",
    3: "Charlie"
};
```

In this example, `userNames` is an object where the keys are numbers and the values are strings.

### Use Cases

* **Dictionary-like Structures**: When you need to create objects that map keys to values, similar to dictionaries or maps.
* **Configuration Maps**: When you need to define configuration settings where the keys are known and the values have a specific type.
* **Lookup Tables**: When you need a quick way to look up values by keys.

### Benefits

* **Type Safety**: Ensures that keys and values conform to specified types, reducing the risk of type errors.
* **Clarity**: Makes the intended structure of objects clear, improving code readability.
* **Flexibility**: Can be used to represent a wide variety of key-value mappings, making it a versatile tool in type definitions.

### Example with String Keys and Custom Types

Suppose you have a `Product` interface and you want to create a mapping of product IDs to products:

```typescript
interface Product {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    price: number;
}

const products: Record<string, Product> = {
    "product1": { id: 1, name: "Laptop", price: 1000 },
    "product2": { id: 2, name: "Phone", price: 500 }
};
```

In this example, `products` is an object where the keys are strings (product IDs) and the values are of type `Product`.
