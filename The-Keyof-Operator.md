# The `keyof` operator

### Problem

https://typehero.dev/challenge/keyof

#

### Problem Description

The keyof operator in TypeScript extracts a union of keys from a type, simplifying type management. Using keyof with typeof, you can automatically create a union type of all keys in an object. This ensures accuracy and reduces redundancy in type definitions. It is especially useful for functions that need to validate keys against an existing object.

### Solution

```ts
type CasettesByArtist = typeof casettesByArtist;
type Artist = keyof CasettesByArtist;
```
