# 7. implement Exclude<T, E>

In TypeScript, the Exclude<T, E> utility type is a built-in generic type that constructs a new type by excluding from union type T all types that are assignable to E. This can be useful when you want to create a type that represents all values from a type T except for those that are also part of type E.

### Syntax

```typescript
type Exclude<T, U> = T extends U ? never : T;
```

### Explanation

* `Exclude<T, E>` takes two type parameters: `T` (the original type) and `E` (the type to exclude from `T`).
* `T extends U ? never : T` is a conditional type that results in `never` for any type in `T` that is assignable to `E`, effectively excluding those types from the result.

#

### Problem Description

`Exclude<T, K>` returns a type by removing from T the union members that are assignable to K.

Please implement `MyExclude<T, K>` by yourself.

```ts
type Foo = 'a' | 'b' | 'c';

type A = MyExclude<Foo, 'a'>; // 'b' | 'c'
type B = MyExclude<Foo, 'c'>; // 'a' | 'b
type C = MyExclude<Foo, 'c' | 'd'>; // 'a' | 'b'
type D = MyExclude<Foo, 'a' | 'b' | 'c'>; // never
```

#

### Solution

```ts
type MyExclude<T, E> = T extends E ? never : T;
```

### Explanation

- `SomeType extends OtherType ? TrueType : FalseType` is a [**conditional type**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html). If `SomeType` is assignable to `OtherType` then `TrueType` is returned; otherwise `FalseType` is returned. When `SomeType` is a union type, [conditional types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html) become [**distributive**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html#distributive-conditional-types), which means the condition is distributed to each branch of that union type:

  ```ts
  // if T = A | B

  T extends U ? X : T == (A extends U ? X : A) | (B extends U ? X : B)
  ```

- The `never` type indicates the values that will never occur. When used in [**conditional types**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html), it prunes unwanted cases.



### Use Cases

* **Filtered Union Types**: When you need to create a new union type that excludes certain values from an existing union type.
* **Type Constraints**: When you want to limit the possible values of a type by excluding specific values.
* **Function Parameters**: When a function should accept all values of a union type except for certain excluded values.

### Benefits

* **Type Safety**: Ensures that the resulting type accurately reflects the exclusion of specified values, reducing the risk of type errors.
* **Flexibility**: Allows you to easily create new types by excluding values from an existing union type, making your code more modular and reusable.
* **Clarity**: Makes it clear which values are intentionally excluded from a type, improving code readability and maintainability.
