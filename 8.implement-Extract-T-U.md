# 8. implement Extract<T, U>

In TypeScript, the Extract<T, U> utility type is a built-in generic type that constructs a new type by extracting from union type T all types that are assignable to U. This can be useful when you want to create a type that represents only the values from a union type T that are also part of type U.


### Syntax

```typescript
type Extract<T, U> = T extends U ? T : never;
```

### Explanation

* `Extract<T, U>` takes two type parameters: `T` (the original type) and `U` (the type to extract from `T`).
* `T extends U ? T : never` is a conditional type that results in `T` for any type in `T` that is assignable to `U`, and `never` otherwise, effectively extracting those types.

#

### Problem Description

As the opposite of [Exclude<T, K>](https://bigfrontend.dev/typescript/implement-Exclude-T-E), `Extract<T, U>` returns a type by extracting union members from T that are assignable to U.

Please implement `MyExtract<T, U>` by yourself.

```ts
type Foo = 'a' | 'b' | 'c';

type A = MyExtract<Foo, 'a'>; // 'a'
type B = MyExtract<Foo, 'a' | 'b'>; // 'a' | 'b'
type C = MyExtract<Foo, 'b' | 'c' | 'd' | 'e'>; // 'b' | 'c'
type D = MyExtract<Foo, never>; // never
```

#

### Solution

```ts
type MyExtract<T, U> = T extends U ? T : never;
```

### Use Cases

* **Filtered Union Types**: When you need to create a new union type that includes only specific values from an existing union type.
* **Type Constraints**: When you want to focus on a subset of values in a union type.
* **Function Parameters**: When a function should accept only specific values from a larger union type.

### Benefits

* **Type Safety**: Ensures that the resulting type accurately reflects the inclusion of specified values, reducing the risk of type errors.
* **Flexibility**: Allows you to easily create new types by including values from an existing union type, making your code more modular and reusable.
* **Clarity**: Makes it clear which values are intentionally included in a type, improving code readability and maintainability.
