# 16. implement FirstChar\<T\>

To define a FirstChar<T> utility type in TypeScript that extracts the first character type from a string literal type T, we can use conditional types and template literal types available in TypeScript 4.1 and later versions. Here's how you can achieve this:


### Definition

```typescript
type FirstChar<T extends string> = T extends `${infer First}${infer _}` ? First : never;
```

### Explanation

1. **Type Parameter and Constraint**
    
    ```typescript
    type FirstChar<T extends string>
    ```
    
    * `FirstChar<T>` is a generic type that takes a type parameter `T`. This parameter is constrained (`extends string`) to ensure that `T` is a string literal type or a string.
2. **Conditional Type**
    
    ```typescript
    T extends `${infer First}${infer _}` ? First : never;
    ```
    
    * This is a conditional type, which has the following structure:
        * `T extends` ${infer First}${infer _}``
        * `? First`
        * `: never`
3. **Template Literal Types**
    
    * `${infer First}${infer _}`: This is a template literal type pattern. Template literal types allow TypeScript to infer parts of a string type based on its structure.
        * `${infer First}`: This captures the first character of the string.
        * `${infer _}`: This matches the rest of the string after the first character, but it's not captured (`_` indicates that it's ignored in the inference).
    * If `T` matches the pattern `${infer First}${infer _}` , TypeScript infers the type of `First` as the type of the first character of `T`.
4. **Conditional Expression**
    
    * `T extends` ${infer First}${infer _} `? First : never;`
        * If `T` matches the pattern `${infer First}${infer _}`, then `First` is returned as the result of the type expression (`First` represents the type of the first character).
        * If `T` does not match the pattern (for example, if `T` is an empty string `""`), TypeScript returns `never`. `never` is a bottom type in TypeScript, representing a type that has no values.



### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/typescript/FirstChar

#

### Problem Description

Please implement `FirstChar<T>` to get the first character of a string.

```ts
type A = FirstChar<'BFE'>; // 'B'
type B = FirstChar<'dev'>; // 'd'
type C = FirstChar<''>; // never
```

#

### Solution

```ts
type FirstChar<T extends string> = T extends `${infer S}${any}` ? S : never;
```

### Use Cases

* **String Manipulation**: Extracting the first character of a known string literal type.
* **Type Validation**: Ensuring types conform to expected patterns (like checking the first character of specific string inputs).

### Benefits

* **Type Safety**: Ensures that you're working with specific characters or patterns within TypeScript's type system.
* **Template Literal Types**: Utilizes TypeScript's latest features to handle string manipulation directly in type definitions.
* **Conditional Typing**: Provides flexibility to define type behaviors based on conditions, enhancing type definitions.
