# 5. implement Pick<T, K>

In TypeScript, the Pick<T, K> utility type is a built-in generic type that allows you to create a new type by selecting a subset of properties K from an existing type T. This can be useful when you need to work with objects that only require a few specific properties from a larger type.


### Syntax

```typescript
type Pick<T, K extends keyof T> = {
    [P in K]: T[P];
};
```

### Problem

#

### Problem Description

`Pick<T, K>`, as the name implies, returns a new type by picking properties in K from T.

Please implement `MyPick<T, K>` by yourself.

```ts
type Foo = {
  a: string;
  b: number;
  c: boolean;
};

type A = MyPick<Foo, 'a' | 'b'>; // {a: string, b: number}
type B = MyPick<Foo, 'c'>; // {c: boolean}
type C = MyPick<Foo, 'd'>; // Error
```

#

### Solution

```ts
type MyPick<T, K extends keyof T> = {
  [P in K]: T[P];
};
```

### Explanation

* `Pick<T, K>` takes two type parameters: `T` (the original type) and `K` (a union of keys to select from `T`).
* `K extends keyof T` ensures that `K` is a subset of the keys of `T`.
* The resulting type is an object with only the properties specified in `K`.


### Example

Suppose you have the following interface:

```typescript
interface User {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    email: string;
    age: number;
}
```

Using `Pick<User, 'id' | 'name'>`, you can create a type with only the `id` and `name` properties:

```typescript
type UserPreview = Pick<User, 'id' | 'name'>;

const userPreview: UserPreview = {
    id: 1,
    name: "Alice"
};
```

In this example, `UserPreview` is a type with only the `id` and `name` properties from `User`.

### Use Cases

* **Simplified Objects**: When you need to create simplified versions of a complex object with only a few relevant properties.
* **Function Parameters**: When a function requires only a subset of properties from a larger object.
* **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**: When defining objects for data transfer that only include necessary properties.

### Benefits

* **Type Safety**: Ensures that the selected properties are valid and conform to the types defined in `T`.
* **Flexibility**: Allows you to easily create new types from existing ones, making your code more modular and reusable.
* **Clarity**: Helps in making the purpose and structure of new types clear by explicitly specifying the properties they include.

### Advanced Example

Suppose you have a `Product` interface and you want to create a type that only includes the `id` and `name` properties for a product list:

```typescript
interface Product {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    price: number;
    description: string;
}

type ProductListItem = Pick<Product, 'id' | 'name'>;

const productList: ProductListItem[] = [
    { id: 1, name: "Laptop" },
    { id: 2, name: "Phone" }
];
```

In this example, `ProductListItem` is a type with only the `id` and `name` properties from `Product`. The `productList` array contains objects that conform to this new type.
